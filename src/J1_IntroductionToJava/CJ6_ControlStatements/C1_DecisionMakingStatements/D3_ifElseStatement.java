=>The if-else statement is an extension to the if-statement, which uses another block of code, i.e., else block. The else block is executed if the condition of the if-block is evaluated as false.

=> The if statement alone tells us that if a condition is true it will execute a block of statements and if the condition is false it wonâ€™t.
But what if we want to do something else if the condition is false. Here comes the else statement. We can use the else statement with if statement to execute a block of code when the condition is false.

=> Syntax:
            if(condition) {
            statement 1; //executes when if condition is true
            }
            else{
            statement 2; //executes when if condition is false
            }
