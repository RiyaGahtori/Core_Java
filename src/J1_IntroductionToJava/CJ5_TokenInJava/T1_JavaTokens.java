/*
=> These are the smallest element of the Java program. In Java, evey statements and expressions are made up of tokens.
=> The Tokens are the small building blocks of a Java program that are meaningful to the Java compiler.
The Java compiler translates these tokens into Java bytecode. Further, these bytecodes are executed inside the interpreted Java environment.

=> Types of Tokens
1. Keywords
2. Identifiers
3. Literals
4. Operators
5. Separators

//For example,
package J1_IntroductionToJava.CJ5_TokenInJava;

public class T1_JavaTokens {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int a = 10, b=20;
        int c = a+b;
        System.out.println(c);
    }
}
// In the above code snippet, public, class, T1_JavaTokens, {, static, void, main, (, String, args, [, ], ), System, ., out, println, =, +, int, a, b etc. are the Java tokens.
